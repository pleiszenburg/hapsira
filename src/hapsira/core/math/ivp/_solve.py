    """Solve an initial value problem for a system of ODEs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Right-hand side of the system: the time derivative of the state ``y``
        at time ``t``. The calling signature is ``fun(t, y)``, where ``t`` is a
        scalar and ``y`` is an ndarray with ``len(y) = len(y0)``. ``fun`` must
        return an array of the same shape as ``y``. See `vectorized` for more
        information.
    t_span : 2-member sequence
        Interval of integration (t0, tf). The solver starts with t=t0 and
        integrates until it reaches t=tf. Both t0 and tf must be floats
        or values interpretable by the float conversion function.
    y0 : array_like, shape (n,)
        Initial state. For problems in the complex domain, pass `y0` with a
        complex data type (even if the initial value is purely real).
    method : string or `OdeSolver`, optional
        Integration method to use:
            * 'DOP853': Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8 [13]_.
              Python implementation of the "DOP853" algorithm originally
              written in Fortran [14]_. A 7-th order interpolation polynomial
              accurate to 7-th order is used for the dense output.
              Can be applied in the complex domain.
        You can also pass an arbitrary class derived from `OdeSolver` which
        implements the solver.
    events : callable, or list of callables, optional
        Events to track. If None (default), no events will be tracked.
        Each event occurs at the zeros of a continuous function of time and
        state. Each function must have the signature ``event(t, y)`` and return
        a float. The solver will find an accurate value of `t` at which
        ``event(t, y(t)) = 0`` using a root-finding algorithm. By default, all
        zeros will be found. The solver looks for a sign change over each step,
        so if multiple zero crossings occur within one step, events may be
        missed. Additionally each `event` function might have the following
        attributes:

            terminal: bool, optional
                Whether to terminate integration if this event occurs.
                Implicitly False if not assigned.
            direction: float, optional
                Direction of a zero crossing. If `direction` is positive,
                `event` will only trigger when going from negative to positive,
                and vice versa if `direction` is negative. If 0, then either
                direction will trigger event. Implicitly 0 if not assigned.

        You can assign attributes like ``event.terminal = True`` to any
        function in Python.
    **options
        Options passed to a chosen solver. All options available for already
        implemented solvers are listed below.
    first_step : float or None, optional
        Initial step size. Default is `None` which means that the algorithm
        should choose.
    max_step : float, optional
        Maximum allowed step size. Default is np.inf, i.e., the step size is not
        bounded and determined solely by the solver.
    rtol, atol : float or array_like, optional
        Relative and absolute tolerances. The solver keeps the local error
        estimates less than ``atol + rtol * abs(y)``. Here `rtol` controls a
        relative accuracy (number of correct digits), while `atol` controls
        absolute accuracy (number of correct decimal places). To achieve the
        desired `rtol`, set `atol` to be smaller than the smallest value that
        can be expected from ``rtol * abs(y)`` so that `rtol` dominates the
        allowable error. If `atol` is larger than ``rtol * abs(y)`` the
        number of correct digits is not guaranteed. Conversely, to achieve the
        desired `atol` set `rtol` such that ``rtol * abs(y)`` is always smaller
        than `atol`. If components of y have different scales, it might be
        beneficial to set different `atol` values for different components by
        passing array_like with shape (n,) for `atol`. Default values are
        1e-3 for `rtol` and 1e-6 for `atol`.
    jac : array_like, sparse_matrix, callable or None, optional
        Jacobian matrix of the right-hand side of the system with respect
        to y, required by the 'Radau', 'BDF' and 'LSODA' method. The
        Jacobian matrix has shape (n, n) and its element (i, j) is equal to
        ``d f_i / d y_j``.  There are three ways to define the Jacobian:

            * If array_like or sparse_matrix, the Jacobian is assumed to
              be constant. Not supported by 'LSODA'.
            * If callable, the Jacobian is assumed to depend on both
              t and y; it will be called as ``jac(t, y)``, as necessary.
              For 'Radau' and 'BDF' methods, the return value might be a
              sparse matrix.
            * If None (default), the Jacobian will be approximated by
              finite differences.

        It is generally recommended to provide the Jacobian rather than
        relying on a finite-difference approximation.
    jac_sparsity : array_like, sparse matrix or None, optional
        Defines a sparsity structure of the Jacobian matrix for a finite-
        difference approximation. Its shape must be (n, n). This argument
        is ignored if `jac` is not `None`. If the Jacobian has only few
        non-zero elements in *each* row, providing the sparsity structure
        will greatly speed up the computations [10]_. A zero entry means that
        a corresponding element in the Jacobian is always zero. If None
        (default), the Jacobian is assumed to be dense.
        Not supported by 'LSODA', see `lband` and `uband` instead.
    lband, uband : int or None, optional
        Parameters defining the bandwidth of the Jacobian for the 'LSODA'
        method, i.e., ``jac[i, j] != 0 only for i - lband <= j <= i + uband``.
        Default is None. Setting these requires your jac routine to return the
        Jacobian in the packed format: the returned array must have ``n``
        columns and ``uband + lband + 1`` rows in which Jacobian diagonals are
        written. Specifically ``jac_packed[uband + i - j , j] = jac[i, j]``.
        The same format is used in `scipy.linalg.solve_banded` (check for an
        illustration).  These parameters can be also used with ``jac=None`` to
        reduce the number of Jacobian elements estimated by finite differences.
    min_step : float, optional
        The minimum allowed step size for 'LSODA' method.
        By default `min_step` is zero.

    Returns
    -------
    Bunch object with the following fields defined:
    t : ndarray, shape (n_points,)

    y : ndarray, shape (n, n_points)

    sol : `OdeSolution` or None
        Found solution as `OdeSolution` instance; None if `dense_output` was

    t_events : list of ndarray or None

        that type event was detected. None if `events` was None.
    y_events : list of ndarray or None
